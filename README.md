# da-dis
Digital Architecture Dynamic Interactive Schematics

The aim of the project is to develop a light-weight JavaScript library for in-browser dynamic interactive informal visualisations of formal system and enterprise architecture models. 

A typical use case for the Da-DIS library includes the following steps:
  1.	A formal architecture model is defined using an architecture modelling tool, for example Sparx Systems EA.
  2.	The full formal model or a model sub-set is exported into a model interchange format.
  3.	An informal non-technical view template of the architecture model is created in MS VISIO.
  4.	The VISIO template is saved in SVG format.
  5.	The exported formal model package and the SVG informal view template are imported into a DA-DIS web application.
  6.	Multiple informal SVG templates and formal model extracts are packaged into one self-contained DA-DIS HTML/SVG application.
  7.	Stakeholders can access the DA-DIS informal visualisations of architectural models from a local hard drive or from the web.
